	title = {The semi-{Lagrangian} technique in atmospheric modelling: current status and future challenges},
	abstract = {The semi-Lagrangian method is an established numerical technique for integrating the transport equations in atmospheric models. Coupled with semi-implicit time-stepping offers unconditional stability for all forcing terms in equation sets of such models. This distinct advantage has led to the development of very efÔ¨Åcient numerical weather prediction systems such as the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS).},
