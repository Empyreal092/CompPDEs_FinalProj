	title = {The semi-{Lagrangian} technique in atmospheric modelling: current status and future challenges},
	abstract = {The semi-Lagrangian method is an established numerical technique for integrating the transport equations in atmospheric models. Coupled with semi-implicit time-stepping offers unconditional stability for all forcing terms in equation sets of such models. This distinct advantage has led to the development of very efﬁcient numerical weather prediction systems such as the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS).},

In the process, it is shown how to construct a semi-Lagrangian scheme which is accurate to third-order.},
